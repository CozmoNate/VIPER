# VIPER Module

## Installation:

Go to folder in Finder: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates

Create folder if not exists and put templates there

Difference between managed and regualar version: Managed module built for delayed initiation. When you need to create instance of the module by a factory, give that instance to another app component and start it sometime later
